Furthen, naturalist aboard the UES [Redacted] in conjunction with the ongoing UES Research and Documentation of Outer Life program. This entry was written at Point Sigma, during an expedition to the dense jungles of Cornea III.\n\n---------------------\n\nI have encountered my first sample of outer life on this planet! What a marvel it is, too. The sample resembles an earthen roundworm, but significantly bigger. I have assigned their common name as 'Detritive Trematode', and will describe their properties below.\n\n• Roughly two inches in diameter, and varying in size from about four inches to a foot and a half in length. White coloration.\n\n• These trematodes were found feasting on a pile of rotting meat in a damp cavern. The meat was of indeterminate origin, but the presence of other, larger animals is exciting nonetheless.\n\n• Upon scooping up a clump of the rotting meat, the trematodes quickly reacted to the movement and began wriggling around, before slowly relaxing. The guard positioned with me, Chevry, I think, was disgusted.\n\n• Upon touching one with an ungloved hand to feel their texture, one of the trematodes latched onto my palm and began chewing. It was extremely painful, both to have the trematode on my hand, and when Chevry cut the thing off. Despite that, other than a light gash on my palm, I believe I am fine.\n",

There wasn't much different from any other workshop of the same niche. A bunch of old kinds of swords, armor, farming equipment, et cetera. Though it would seem the forget was a hobbyist himself, as there were what looked to be some projects you normally wouldn't find there in the back.\n\nA fair amount of them were nothing more than motors and metal. He seemed to practice making clockwork. But he eventually moved on to fuel and engine based items. Old lawn mowers, motor cycles, and generators. He eventually moved on to propulsion systems. Small remote planes, helicopters, an old rusty jetpack. It seemed he was working up to something, and we found what it was in the back.\n\nThere was clearly some genius behind him. He was building a pair of jet boots from scratch. They haven't entered production before, since jetpacks do the job fine, and boots can't be as sturdy and heavy while getting the same amount of thrust. He seemed to have the same thought, as he made them more sturdy for his protection, but tried to compensate by turning up the output on the thrust. The result ended in the heat building up and erupting from below him. Unfortunately, his inventive nature cost him his business and his life.\n\nThe surrounding area didn't take any damage so the shop may be renovated soon. The boots have been confiscated and are en route to be studied and decommissioned, and the remaining items from inside the shop have been sent to their next of kin.\n\nThis concludes my report.\n",

Concerned that someone might have tried to ship a living animal under Standard protocol, he felt the need to investigate. Instead, what was in the chest was a small plastic package containing a large number of particularly sizable sewing needles, obviously packaged far too tightly for any amount of safety.\n\nFinally, and, likely in a lapse of judgement, Will decided to touch the package.

She was the last of her line, with no living brothers, sisters, or children.\n\nInstead, in her final testament, her wisdom has created a new beginning. For us. For all of us. Her wish is that the remaining members of this community spread out, either together or separately, into the world. It is perhaps a drastic option, but one that I, personally, also believe to be the best for this community.\n\nNkota shall be buried at our final destination, as is her will.

The functionality of a unit is exponentially increased depending on the mood of the troops within it. This can be raised or lowered through various means. For example, the quality of their lodging or food, news they've heard from their home, or even spending time recreationally.\n\nHowever, one tried and true method of raising the morale of a unit is the usage of symbolism. Many armies would wear colors and designs symbolizing their beliefs and their strength. Many units would carry flags in order to keep their morale high in combat.\n\nThe usage of this method has also seen variations. While a flag bearer for a unit will increase morale, it has been observed that flags unique to higher ranking military will further increase the unit's morale. Should a Colonel or General's flag appear on the battlefield, the troops will be encouraged by the power they display, and in turn increase their own fighting prowess.\n",
